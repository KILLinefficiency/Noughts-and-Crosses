# Noughts-and-Crosses
A simple textual Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++

I saw everyone making this game with their own techniques but for no reason.
So for no reason at all I decided to do the same in C++ with my own technique.

### Compiling and Running on Linux, BSD, macOS and WSL:
```
$ g++ game.cpp -o game
$ ./game
```

### Compiling and Running on Windows:
Find and replace ``clear`` with ``cls`` in the file ``game.cpp``.

Use whichever compiler you wish!

### Game Guide:
Everyone knows how to play this game...

The position for a Nought(O) or a Cross(X) is taken in the sequence: ``row_number column_number`` i.e separated by a space.
